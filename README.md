## Introduction

Spin is a full stack web application built primarily with React and Django. It aims to emulate a basic online economy by allowing players to spin a wheel to obtain collectibles, which can later be sold on the market to other players using a fictional currency called *SP* (Spin Points).

## Schematics

Spin consists of 3 major components: 
1. A frontend built using React.js and hosted on Vercel
2. A backend built using Django and hosted on Heroku
3. An independent Socket.io server hosted on Replit
